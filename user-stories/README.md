# User Stories Documentation – Airbnb Clone Backend  

## 📌 Introduction  
This part of the project focuses on **user-centered design**. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the end-user. They help the development team stay aligned with real-world needs while building the backend system.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The goal of documenting user stories is to:  
- Define **clear requirements** for backend functionality.  
- Ensure that both **guests and hosts** have their needs captured.  
- Provide developers with **actionable guidance** for implementation.  
- Support agile development through **incremental feature delivery**.  

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Actors Covered  
The user stories in this module cover interactions for:  
- **Guests** – users who book properties.  
- **Hosts** – users who list and manage properties.  
- **Admins** – users who oversee the platform’s integrity and operations.  

## 📂 Files in This Directory  
- **`user-stories.md`** → Contains the detailed user stories derived from the system’s use cases.  
- **`README.md`** → Provides context and explanation for how user stories guide backend development.  

## 🚀 Next Steps  
- Translate user stories into **backend requirements** (APIs, database models, business logic).  
- Use them to design **test cases** that validate functionality.  
- Continuously refine stories as new requirements emerge.
